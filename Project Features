Key Features:

Video Feed Analysis:
Our Social Distance Analyzer utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze video feeds from surveillance 
cameras, CCTV systems, or live camera streams in real-time. By processing these feeds, the system can accurately detect and track individuals in the monitored area.

Social Distance Monitoring:
The analyzer continuously monitors the distance between people within the designated area. It calculates the physical separation
between individuals and identifies whether they are complying with recommended social distancing guidelines.

Real-time Notifications:
If the system detects individuals failing to maintain a safe distance, it immediately triggers real-time notifications. 
These notifications can be sent to both the individuals involved and the designated authority, such as security personnel or management staff.

Customizable Safety Thresholds:
The Social Distance Analyzer allows for customizable safety thresholds based on local guidelines and requirements. 
The user can set specific distance parameters, and the system will flag any violations accordingly.

Privacy-conscious Design:
We understand the importance of privacy, and our system is designed with this in mind. 
The analyzer focuses solely on assessing social distancing compliance without identifying individuals or capturing sensitive data.

Integration and Scalability:
Our solution is designed to be easily integrated into existing surveillance systems or live camera feeds. 
Whether it's a small business, public venue, or large-scale event, our Social Distance Analyzer can be scaled to suit various environments.

Data Insights and Reporting:
The system records and compiles valuable data on social distancing compliance over time. 
This data can be accessed through comprehensive reports, enabling stakeholders to assess trends and take proactive measures to enhance safety protocols.

In these challenging times, ensuring public safety is of paramount importance. Our Social Distance Analyzer empowers businesses, organizations, 
and authorities to proactively enforce social distancing measures, reduce COVID-19 transmission risks, and protect the well-being of the community.
